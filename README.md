Fork was modified to work with Neopixel LED. At the moment 6 Led's are supported.

## Setup - Flashing

For easy setup use my Flash Homepage: [https://vr6syncro.de/programmer/flash.html](https://vr6syncro.de/programmer/flash.html)

## Wiring

Up to 6 Led is supported with internal USB Power on the Wemos D1 mini if u are not modify the brightness in the firmware otherwise there ther might be some issues.

5V Power pin to LED + / 5V Pin
G / Ground pin to G / Ground Pin
D2 pin to DIN on the first LED

If you use a Led Strip thats it otherwise you continue soldering from the dout side of the led to the next led din side.
